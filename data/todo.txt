Instructions 
alright we're going to build a kaya index for electricity only using iea data. 
1. we're going to need to scrape the data we have the above list of countries 
    a. you can see the url pattern here, we'll need to use selenium because it looks like it does something clientside, please leave 1.3 seconds between downloads and 3 seconds between pages. throw a catch on this if it doesn't download see next point 
    b. if we get the following error we need to refresh selenium and re navigate there. actually maybe even refresh selenium every 5 countries. here is the error   ✗ Error: Message: invalid session id; For documentation on this error, please visit: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/troubleshooting/errors#invalidsessionidexception
    c. here is button #1 for generation by source:

    g. make a test with just canada, I've manually downloaded the files so we can check for equality
    h. run the script
    i. make a script to load this into a sqlite db.  
    j. run script to load into db

2. we want to build a visualisation with js, I want to be able to do a wasm compile for offline use
    a. I'd like this to have the globe map as a heatmap
    b. I want a drop down to select the indicator [generation,consuption, emissions] that is shown as a heatmap
    c. when a country is clicked I want a side panel to come out and the graphs of [generation,consuption, emissions] to come out. this should be half the width of the screen
    d. I'd like this all to be realtively straight forward to be able to port to a different project
